# Memory Palace MCP 🏰

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/memory-palace-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/memory-palace-mcp)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that implements the ancient "Method of Loci" (Memory Palace) technique for enhanced learning and memory retention. This MCP helps users create virtual memory palaces, organize information spatially, and build memory journeys for effective recall.

## Features ✨

- **🏰 Create Memory Palaces**: Build themed virtual spaces (ancient, modern, nature, space, underwater, library)
- **🏠 Room Management**: Create and organize rooms within palaces with 3D positioning
- **📝 Memory Items**: Store information with visual cues (images, icons, colors, shapes)
- **🗺️ Memory Journeys**: Create guided paths through your palace for structured review
- **🔍 Smart Search**: Find memory items by content, title, or tags
- **📊 Analytics**: Track review counts and get statistics about your memory palaces

## Advanced Features 🔬

### Spaced Repetition
The system tracks review counts and last review dates, helping you identify items that need more attention.

### Spatial Intelligence
3D positioning helps leverage spatial memory for better recall. Items placed in memorable locations are easier to remember.

### Multi-sensory Encoding
Visual cues engage multiple memory pathways, making information more memorable and easier to retrieve.

## Memory Science 🧠

This MCP is based on the **Method of Loci**, a mnemonic technique dating back to ancient Greece. Research shows that spatial memory is one of our strongest memory systems, making this technique highly effective for:

- **Enhanced Recall**: Spatial context improves memory retrieval
- **Long-term Retention**: Visual-spatial encoding creates lasting memories
- **Complex Information**: Breaking down information into manageable, memorable chunks
- **Active Learning**: Creating palaces engages multiple cognitive processes
